Remember to modify the information above.
\subsubsection*{The following will give you an overview of what you can do with this template.}

\begin{Problem}
Type your problem here. \\
Personally I recommend Mathpix (https://mathpix.com/), which can easily export your ProblemBook.pdf to \LaTeX \ code.
\end{Problem}

\begin{Solution}
Write your solution here.

Example of equations. $x+1=2$. Or
$$x-1=0$$

Example of a list of equations.
\begin{align*}
    x &= 1\\
    y &= 2
\end{align*}

Example of a matrix.
$$\begin{pmatrix}1&0\\0&1\end{pmatrix}$$

Example of a lemma.
\begin{lemma}
    This is a lemma.
\end{lemma}

Example of a proof.
\begin{proof}
    Write your proof here.
\end{proof}

Example of including a picture.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width = 4cm]{icl_logo.png}
\end{center}

Example of referring to a piece of code.
\lstinputlisting[language = python]{Program Solution.py}

Example of a table.
\begin{equation*}\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
                & Mean          & SD \\ 
     Fall 2077  & 7.046512      & 1.714552 \\  
     Fall 1977  & 9.102941      & 1.568919
\end{tabular}\end{equation*}

Overall, this is a quite basic template for assignments, and above are only some basic features. I included enough packages and set a few environments. You may modify them or add features to fit your personal preference. Enjoy using it!
